# Introduction

Welcome to the Skyfish/Colourbox Developer Site. Here, you will find all of the resources you need to create a custom integration between your system and Skyfish or Colourbox. This site collects together all of the developer tools and technical documentation that developers need to get the most out of the platforms.

First, make sure to read our Getting Started Guide. This guide will help you, as a developer, achieve a thorough overview of Skyfish’s various integration tools. You’ll become familiar with our Skyfish API, as well as SDKs for using some of the most popular programming languages with the API.

If you do not find what you are looking for, or if you have any technical questions, please reach out to us at api@colourbox.com. We'll be happy to help you.

If you are searching for more general Skyfish information, and it is not already on the Skyfish website, then email us with your inquiry at info@colourbox.com.

# Getting Started
To begin using the Skyfish API, you need to have an API key and an API secret. To see the key and secret associated with your Skyfish account, visit: [https://www.skyfish.com/account/api](https://www.skyfish.com/account/api)
If you do not have access to this page, or your key/secret are missing from it, then contact your company's Skyfish Specialist. They will help you set up your access to the API. 

Once you have the key and secret, you are ready to use the API. Your next step is to set up [authentication](/authentication).

For a list of all supported API endpoints, visit [https://api.skyfish.com/](https://api.skyfish.com/).
